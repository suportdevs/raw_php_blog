				<h2>About us</h2>
	
				<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:

                Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
                Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
                Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps
                You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.

                To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.</p>
				
				<h3>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</h3>

                <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

                When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.

                When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>
